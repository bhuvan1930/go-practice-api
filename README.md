# Go Practice API

This is a simple Go REST API built with the [Fiber](https://gofiber.io/) web framework. It was created as part of a personal project to explore backend development in Go.

## Features

- GET `/` – Root endpoint returns a welcome message
- GET `/weather` – Returns a mock list of weather conditions
- POST `/weather` – Accepts new weather data (coming soon!)

## Run Locally
